* Concepts

** overview
- we use kubernetes api objects to describe cluster's desired state
  - what applications to run
  - what container image they use
  - no of raplicas
  - network and disk/cpu usage

- kubernetes performs variety of tasks automatically
  - starting/restarting containers
  - scaling no of replicas
 
- kubernetes master- three processes that run on a single node
  - kube-apiserver
  - kube-controller-manager
  - kube-scheduler
 
- other/worker node - two processes on each node
  - kubelet: communicates with the master
  - kube-proxy: proxy network that reflects networking services on each node
  
** kubernetes-objects
- basic objects
  - pod
  - service
  - volume
  - namespace
  
- high level abstractions: controllers
  - based on basic objects
  - provides additional functionality
    
- controllers
  - replicaset
  - deployment
  - statefulset
  - daemonset
  - job
  
** kubernetes control plane
- govern how kubernetes communicates with the cluster
- maintains record of all objects
- runs continuous loop to manage those objects state
- responses to change in the claster: work to make actual state to match desired state for all objects


*** kubernetes master
- maintains desired state of the cluster

*** kubernetes nodes
- machines (vm/physical server)
- run apps
- managed my master
